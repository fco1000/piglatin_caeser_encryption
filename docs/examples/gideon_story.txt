Gideon and the Midianites: a concise retelling

In the days when the Israelites again did what was wrong in the sight of the Lord, the people suffered under the oppression of the Midianites. Year after year the Midianite bands would raid the land, taking crops, livestock, and leaving the people to hide in mountain clefts and caves. The nation was impoverished, frightened, and scattered.

Into this scene came Gideon, a man of humble origin — threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the enemy. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and called him "mighty man of valor," commissioning him to deliver Israel. Gideon was filled with doubt: he questioned the angel, asked for signs, and struggled with the sense that such a task could come to someone from his family and town.

To reassure him, Gideon asked for a sign. He prepared an offering; the angel caused fire to consume it. Still uncertain, Gideon set out a wool fleece: first he asked that the fleece be wet with dew while the ground stayed dry, and then he asked the opposite — that the fleece be dry while the ground was wet. On both occasions God granted the sign, and Gideon's confidence grew bit by bit.

Gideon gathered an army to confront Midian: tens of thousands answered the call. But God told him the force was too large; the Lord did not want Israel to boast that his own power had saved them. So the army was whittled down — first by those who were afraid, then by a test at the water that left only three hundred men. With only these three hundred and a handful of supporters, Gideon prepared to attack.

That night Gideon divided his small band into companies and surrounded the Midianite camp. Each man carried a trumpet and a clay jar with a torch inside. At Gideon's signal they blew the trumpets, broke the jars so the torches flamed, and shouted. Confusion erupted in the enemy camp: men turned on one another in panic, and many fled. Israel's enemies were routed with scarcely any direct combat.

The victory was decisive. Gideon pursued the fleeing hosts, and the land experienced peace for a time. People wanted to make Gideon their king, but he refused, insisting that the Lord should rule over Israel. Later, however, Gideon made an ephod that became a snare to his family, and the people again fell into idolatrous patterns.

Gideon's story is remembered as a tale of unlikely heroism: a call to an ordinary man, tests of faith, the wisdom of relying on God's power rather than numbers, and the lingering human weaknesses that follow success. It is rich with punctuation, contractions, hyphenated-words, dialogue-markers, and varied sentence lengths — making it a useful text for testing transformations like Pig Latin and Caesar shifts.
